        "assetType": "crypto",
        "price": 3000.00,
        "timestamp": "2024-03-14T12:00:00.000Z"

  }
}
```

- `symbols`: Comma-separated list of symbols (optional)

Example for crypto:
```http
GET /api/prices/crypto?symbols=bitcoin,ethereum
Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "symbol": "bitcoin",
      "assetType": "crypto",
      "price": 50000.00,
      "timestamp": "2024-03-14T12:00:00.000Z"

- `forex`: Forex prices (coming soon)
- `commodities`: Commodity prices (coming soon)

Note: All price routes require authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Trade Routes

#### POST /api/trades
Create a new trade entry.
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "entryPrice": 150.25,
  "quantity": 10,
  "direction": "long",
  "stopLoss": 145.00,
  "takeProfit": 160.00,
  "reason": "Strong breakout with high volume",
  "tags": ["breakout", "volume"]
}
```
The system will automatically:
- Analyze the trade reason for emotional content using FinBERT
- Extract relevant trading strategy tags
- Combine them with user-provided tags

Emotion labels stored under `emotionAnalysis.detected` use FinBERT outcomes: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`.

#### GET /api/trades
Get all trades with pagination and sorting.
Query Parameters:
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Items per page (default: 10)
- `sort`: Sort field (default: -tradeDate)

#### GET /api/trades/stats
Get trading statistics including:
- Overall performance metrics
- Win rate by tag
- Profit/loss analysis
- Trade frequency analysis

#### GET /api/trades/:id
Get a specific trade by ID.

#### PATCH /api/trades/:id
Update a trade. Allowed fields:
- symbol
- entryPrice
- exitPrice
- quantity
- direction
- stopLoss
- takeProfit
- reason
- tags
- result
- profitLoss
- notes
- chartScreenshot
- exitReason
- postTradeReview (object)

When you update `reason`, the system re-runs emotion analysis and enriches `tags` based on detected keywords. When you update `exitReason`, the system saves `exitEmotionAnalysis` (FinBERT labels) and, if any exit-related fields change (`exitPrice`, `exitReason`, `postTradeReview`, `result`, `profitLoss`), it generates a fresh `postTradeAnalysis` using Google Gemini and embeds it under `postTradeAnalysis`.

#### DELETE /api/trades/:id
Delete a trade.

### AI Explanation Routes

#### POST /api/explain
Get AI explanation of any text with optional context.
```json

    }
  ],
  "basedOnTrades": 25,
  "userContext": {
    "winRate": "48.00",

## Additional Insights (from trading logs)

- Profit percentage (per trade): Derived from stored fields when an exit exists.
  - Formula: `profitPercentage = (profitLoss / (entryPrice * quantity)) * 100`
  - Notes:
    - Positive for profitable trades, negative for losing trades
    - Can be summarized across a set of trades (e.g., average profit percentage) in reports/insights
    - Since `profitLoss`, `entryPrice`, and `quantity` are already stored, this can be computed client- or server-side without schema changes

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Security

- All routes except registration and login require JWT authentication
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Input validation and sanitization on all routes
